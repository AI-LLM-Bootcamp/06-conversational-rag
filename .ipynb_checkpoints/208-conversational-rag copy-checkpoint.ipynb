    "   - **Updating the Retriever**: The system updates its information retrieval process to a new version that is aware of the conversation history. This new version is called `history_aware_retriever`.\n",
    "   - **Generating Answers**: A function named `create_stuff_documents_chain` is used to construct a `question_answer_chain`. This chain takes the rephrased query, the conversation history, and any relevant retrieved information to produce an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Chain Assembly**:\n",
    "   - A final process chain, referred to as `rag_chain`, is created using another function called `create_retrieval_chain`.\n",
    "   - This chain first uses the `history_aware_retriever` to gather information relevant to the rephrased query and the conversation history.\n",
    "   - Then, the `question_answer_chain` uses this information along with the initial query and chat history to generate an answer.\n",
    "   - The system keeps track of all the intermediate information (like the retrieved context) to make the process more efficient and transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the system enhances the accuracy and relevance of responses in a conversation by ensuring that every new question is considered in the full context of what has been previously discussed."

    "Let's now focus on how to handle and maintain chat history in the question and answer (Q&A) application to make conversations flow more naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stateful Management of Chat History**: Instead of manually entering previous parts of the conversation every time a new input is made, the application can automatically manage and update chat history. This means that the application remembers past interactions and uses that information to understand and respond to new questions more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tools for Managing Chat History**:\n",
    "   - **BaseChatMessageHistory**: This component is responsible for storing the history of the conversation.\n",
    "   - **RunnableWithMessageHistory**: This acts as a wrapper around the main processing chain (LCEL chain) and the chat history storage (BaseChatMessageHistory). It takes care of adding the historical chat data to new inputs and updating the stored history after each response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How It Works**: When you use these components in an application:\n",
    "   - The application automatically retrieves and updates the chat history every time it processes a new input. This helps in maintaining a continuous and coherent conversation flow.\n",
    "   - For example, when using `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, it manages chat history using a configuration that includes a unique session identifier (`session_id`). This identifier helps the system know which conversation history to retrieve and update whenever a user interacts with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example of Implementation**: In a simple implementation, chat histories might be stored in a basic dictionary. More complex systems might use databases like Redis to ensure more reliable and long-term storage of conversation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these tools and methods help a Q&A application remember and utilize previous interactions, making the conversation feel more natural and informed."
